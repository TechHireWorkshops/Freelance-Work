# Freelance Work

Finding freelance work is a good way of challenging yourself to improve your skills, build you portfolio, and make some money. Your first few jobs may be small or tough, but there is a lot of freelance work out there for web devs. 

There are a few ways to find these jobs, some of which may be less apparent than others, and many of these methods are worth exploring.  Once you find a job, there are some best practices that can ensure that you get a fair deal and can work in a comfortable environment.

## Finding Freelance Jobs

Every business, artist, organization, etc needs a website.  Many are small enough that their needs can be taken care of by a single person or small group, and they find their devs in a variety of ways.  Where could we look to find freelance work?

### Reach out to place in need of your services

This option is surprisingly viable, but can be work and rejection heavy.  Look around the internet for local stores, restaurants, and businesses that have websites in need to update.  Send an email, call, or meet the owner in person to talk about what you can offer them.

Sell them on the idea that a website is a worthwhile expense and will generate business. Some of these places may agree that a new website is a good investment, though many will feel it's unimportant (otherwise, they would likely have a newer website already).  You may need to offer a low rate in these situation.

### Your Network

It's very true that finding work is about who you know. Many jobs are word of mouth, whether that be an acquaintance with a business remarking that they've been thinking about updating their site, or an offer from a fellow boot camp graduate to work a project with them.  You should stay in touch with people you meet through coding and keep an ear open for job offers.

Your boot camp colleague may be your best bet, but there are plenty of places to meet other coders. Look at Meetup to find groups your interested in, and attend events with like-minded devs.  You can also contribute to discussions in forums like reddit or stackoverflow.  Connections often come from unexpected places.

You can also feel free to reach out to former colleagues and employers, especially if they're in a tech context.  It might feel a little gauche to send out emails asking for work (maybe it even is), but a lot of jobs are generated that way.  Don't be afraid to ask for things you want.

### Freelance Websites

There are many web dev freelancing sites to find work on.  They fall into 2 main types: bidding and matching sites.

#### Bidding Sites

Sites like Fiverr, Freelancer, Upwork, and others exist on a bidding system.  Either clients post a project, and devs put in bids for the work, or devs advertise themselves and their prices.  Depending on the site, devs can post descriptions of their services, requirements, examples of past projects, and reviews from former clients.

Breaking into these sites can take a little time, and likely a few low-paying jobs.  Before you have reviews from other users on the sites, many clients are hesitant to give you a shot.  You'll probably have to promise a low rate at first, and be very accommodating of the client's needs and wants.  This can be unpleasant.

You should post your most impressive projects on these sites, and a list of all of your skills, especially your abilities with hosting sites and third party apis.  Another thing you can do to stand out on these sites is boast your professionalism and communication skills.  We'll talk more about this later on.

These sites can be a bit of a crapshoot, with clients of all types and levels of integrity in working with freelancers.  The jobs here are also shorter-term, so there is some hustling involved.  You're also encouraged to accept lower rates.  On the other hand, it can be useful in building your portfolio, acquiring new skills, and picking up money on the side.

#### Matching sites

Sites like TopTal, Upstack, lemon.io, and others are sites where both clients and devs are vetted beforehand.  Incoming devs are given a technical evaluation to gain access to the platform, and to give an idea of their specialties and abilities.  When clients bring projects to the platform, their staff matches them with their pool of talent to find the best match.  These sites are similar to headhunting companies.

The advantages here are clear: no competing for jobs with other devs, and a higher class of client who are bound by strong contracts with the platform.  These sites generally offer longer-term contracts with support from the platform throughout the process.  You're also assured that you're able to fulfill your contract with your abilities.

## Communication

Working with a freelancer can be a dicey proposition for a client, as it is for the developer.  You're not sure who you're working with, and if they can meet your needs.  One way to allay this trepidation on the client's behalf is to be a clear communicator, especially with your abilities, your workflow, and your expectations for the relationship between you and the client.

Explain, both in your profile and your work proposal, your abilities in terms of what you can deliver to a client, as well as technically. It can help to explain what your contributions will mean to user experience of the app, and how this can add value to the client's business.  Once you have a project, do your best to estimate the time it will take you do implement features, while acknowledging that these estimates are approximate, and extenuating circumstances can and often do arise.

It can seem counterintuitive to set requirements and restrictions for the client, but this is not the case.  You should explain clearly what needs to be delivered to you before you can begin work, and what will need to be done on the client's part to qualify for and begin revisions to your work.  This will often put the client at ease, as they know they are working with a professional.  Remember that you are advertising yourself as a web developer, and not a general assistant for the company at their beck and call.  Be clear about the stages of your workflow as well, and the time frames of each stage.  Let you client know what stages they will need to be an active participant in.

Once a project is begun, there is no such thing as too much communication. It's almost never a smart move to make decisions about the project without the client's approval, and can create more work on your part.  This can mean reporting progress, reporting issues that have popped up, questions about the direction of the app, and suggestions for changes or improvements.

## Once you've found a job

Once you've got a client interested, the way that you proceed and establish your working relationship can dictate what your working life will be in the following days, weeks, or months. What you absolutely need is a contract.  Not only can this protect you in the case of conflicts, it communicates that your requirements are serious, and keeps both parties civil.

Take a look at [this article](https://medium.com/freelancers-handbook/web-development-contract-6ca825480aa6) and pick the contract that is right for you.

What does this contract need to detail?

### Project Feature Requirements and Process

Your contract should detail what is to be delivered, the time frame of that delivery, and remedies for incompleteness or late delivery.  The individual features should be listed along with an expected date for each of them.  You should also be clear on what role each party needs to play in the completion of each part of the project.  You also need to list any information of funds required for each part of the project.

### Revisions

Revisions can be a touchy part of a web dev contract.  It should be decided beforehand if and when revisions can be requested, and any additional payment required for revisions.  Beware of terms like 'reasonable request' or 'minor changes' and see that those terms are formally explained in the contract to avoid disagreement in the future.

### Payment

Payment structures can vary from contract to contract, and are usually either per-hour or lump-sum.  Per-hour payment is usually more straightforward, but you should still be clear about what an hour of work can be.  You might want to include meetings with the client as a billable hour, or discuss what different rates may look like while working on revisions, or when works more than a set number of hours per week.  If there's any conceivable objection that a client can raise as to what constitutes work, it should be covered in the contract.

Lump sum payment structures have more room for discussion.  They are usually (and should) be broken into several stages and payments.  the simplest of these may be half at the undertaking of the project, and half after delivery and approval from the client. This can also be done in multiple stages for delivery of certain features.

How do you decide whether to charge per-hour or lump-sum?  This can depend on your experience level and the rules around revisions.  If this project has a less well-defined structure or requirements, a per-hour charge is probably the way to go.  This can also cut down on how likely the client is to ask for additional work.  If this is a project you've done before and has a clearly-defined solution in your mind, it may be worth charging a lump sum for the project, and basing the rate on what you might expect a competent developer to receive for this project changing by the hour.
